- In Chemical Engineering whenever you design a process you have to calculate and deliver essential deliverables and tables and Energy Balance table is one of them.
- It refers to the accounting of energy within a chemical process or system. It involves tracking the flow of energy in various forms (like heat, work, or chemical energy) through a process to ensure that energy is conserved according to the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed.

## We have simulated the process on Aspen Hysys and Energy balance was already calculated inside this softeware but for educational purposes I decided to simulate it and compare between my simulation and Aspen Hysys results

## Applications in Chemical Engineering:
----------------------------------------
1. Heat Exchangers: Energy balances are used to calculate the heat transfer required to raise or lower the temperature of fluids.
2. Reactors: In chemical reactors, energy balances help determine the heat produced or required by reactions to maintain specific conditions.
3. Separation Processes: During distillation or other separation processes, energy balances help calculate the heat necessary for phase changes.
4. Optimization of Processes: Engineers use energy balances to optimize processes for energy efficiency and to minimize energy costs.

## Libraries Used:
------------------
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
